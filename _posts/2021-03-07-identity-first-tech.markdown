The Identity First Tech community officially launches. The aim of the community is to gather security and identity professionals from around the world to exchange and promote knowledge on the use of identity technology in building reliable and secure systems. Identity is the foundational building block when it comes to security, yet it is often not prioritised when applications and systems are being developed.

The community has been founded by two professionals with vast experience in identity and access management - Maciej Machulak and Michal Kepkowski.

Dr. Maciej Machulak currently leads enterprise architecture for IAM at HSBC. In the past, Maciej worked for various companies in the identity and access management space and co-authored such specification as the award-winning UMA protocol (Kantara Initiative) or two OAuth-related specifications used in Open Banking (IETF).

Michal Kepkowski is a senior IAM developer with real love for backend and open source technologies. For the last few years, Michal has been leading security development teams at numerous companies. He worked with open source IAM platforms including Keycloak, Gluu and WSO2. Michal is working on his PhD at the Cyber Security Hub at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia - his research focuses on authentication protocols including FIDO2.

We welcome contributions to the community - reach out if you're interested to join!
